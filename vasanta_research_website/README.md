# How to get started
- Run _npm run dev_
- When you make a change, ctrl+s and the webpage will update

# Next Steps:
- Fill out each portion of the website (Research, Contact, Papers, and Home page)
- Each team member creates their webpage (make a template so it is consistent)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
